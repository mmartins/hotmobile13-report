\section{Posters \& Demos}
\label{sec:postersdemos}
Winner of the best demo award, ``Bringing In-situ Social Awareness to Mobile 
Systems: Conversational Turn Monitoring and its Applications'' (Lee et al., 
KAIST) attracted significant attention and discussion from attendees. Their 
system used the smartphone as a mechanism for encouraging in-person interactions
by monitoring conversation patterns. The demo was supported by a video of the 
system in use in a nursery -- encouraging peer-engagement from an otherwise 
withdrawn autistic child. By combining the video with a layout of smartphones 
running their turn-monitoring system (which used coloured bars to indicate 
speakers and conversation duration), attendees were able to see a clear 
demonstration of the capability of the system as well as potential applications
and were rewarded for their interactions with the demonstrators with a clear
representation of their conversation patterns.

``Leveraging Imperfections of Sensor for Fingerprinting Smartphones''
(Dey et al., University of South Carolina) received an honourable mention
as the second best poster/demo of ACM HotMobile'13. By taking advantage of
the subtle imperfections of built-in sensor chips resultant of the
manufacturing process, smartphones could be distinguished with high
accuracy by comparing the sensor readings obtained from a same stimulus.
Considering that smartphone IMEI codes can be counterfeit, sensor
fingerprinting seems a promising alternative for telling devices apart.
