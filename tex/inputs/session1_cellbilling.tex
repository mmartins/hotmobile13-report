\section{Cellular Billing}
\label{sec:cellbilling}

The first session was chaired by Suman Banerjee (University of Wisconsin-Madison)
and began with ``Splitting the Bill for Mobile Data with SIMlets'' presented by 
Alec Wolman (Microsoft Research). Motivated by the limited mobile broadband 
infrastructure, the paper suggests the use of split billing. Split billing allows 
content providers to pay costs generated by mobile users using their services.
trustworthy abstraction whose policy indicates which traffic should be billed to 
which entity. Content providers issue a SIMlet to a mobile device in order to 
specify which data they are prepared to pay for.

Younghwan Go (KAIST) then presented ``Towards Accurate Accounting of Cellular 
Data for TCP Retransmission''. At a transport level, delivery of application data
to the mobile device is augmented by headers and subject to retransmissions. In 
poor infrastructure  conditions, retransmissions can greatly increase the traffic 
exchanged. The authors show that current billing policies vary; some charge the 
user for retransmissions whilst others allow `free-riding' through abuse of 
transport level protocols. By highlighting potential attacks and suggesting 
methods for mitigation, the authors hope that future billing techniques might 
accurately reflect user application data use.
%, preventing overcharging as a result of retransmissions and undercharging as a 
%result of free-riding attacks.
The aspiration towards perfect accounting attracted attention during audience
questions and discussion -- the suggestion of ``unlimited'' data plans as an
alternative to accurate billing was made.
