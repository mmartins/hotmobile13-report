\section{Cellular Billing}
\label{sec:cellbilling}

The first session was chaired by Suman Banerjee (University of Wisconsin-Madison)
and began with ``Splitting the Bill for Mobile Data with SIMlets'' presented by 
Alec Wolman (Microsoft Research). Motivated by the scarcity of mobile broadband 
spectrum, the paper suggests the use of split billing, in which content providers 
can costs generated by mobile users using their services. Such techniques can 
already be seen (\eg{} Amazon Whispernet) but negotiations are restricted to 
large content providers. SIMlets support split billing by providing a
trustworthy abstraction whose policy indicates which traffic should be billed to 
which entity. Content providers issue a SIMlet to a mobile device in order to 
specify which data they are prepared to pay for.

Younghwan Go (KAIST) then presented ``Towards Accurate Accounting of Cellular 
Data for TCP Retransmission''.
