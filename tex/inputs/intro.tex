The Fourteenth Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (HotMobile 
2013) was held over 26th and 27th February at Jekyll Island, Georgia. The worksop 
brought together approximately 90 researchers from academic and industrial 
institutions. A total of seventeen papers were presented during six
sessions (approximately 31\% of the submissions); the workshop
also featured a keynote from  Thad Starner (Georgia Institute of
Technology), a panel on `mobile systems and the developing world' and a
poster and demo session (thirteen posters, six demos). Each of the paper and
panel sessions were followed by a discussion period. This report summarizes the
presentations and discussion that took place during each session.
